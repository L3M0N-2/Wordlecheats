## TO GET GOOD RESULTS
One method to get relatively good results: 

First guess: CRANE 

(Second guess: MOIST)  --- if "CRANE" does not yield good feedback after you process the results with the code 


## HOW TO USE THIS CODE

### GENERAL RULE OF WORDLE
1) Enter any five letter word into the wordle interface
2) you should be getting the letters with three possible colors 
3) if you get a green colored on a letter, that means that letter exist in the answer and is at the correct position. However, it might not be the only appearance of that letter. For example, if the answer is 'deeds' but you guessed 'lemon', then the e in 'lemon' will be colored green, but it doesn't imply that there is only one 'e' in the answer, as seen with 'deeds'. 
4) if you get a yellow colored on a letter, that means that letter exists in the answer but not at the position that you put it at. it also doesn't imply that that letter will not be repeated in the answer. For example, if the answer is 'apple' and you guessed 'lemon' then the 'l' and 'e' will appear yellow. 
5) if you get a grey colored on a letter, that means that letter does not exist in the answer anywhere at all! 

### USING THE CODE KNOWING HOW WORDLE WORKS
1) enter into Wordle a 5 letter word guess. 
2) run the code 
3) the code will prompt "what is the word you tested?" 
4) enter into the code the word you just tested 
5) the code will then prompt " what color are the corresponding places (0 for grey, 1 for yellow, 2 for green)" 
6) enter the color you see on the wordle site corresponding to your guesses 
7) guess another word for your next round and run the code again. 
8) once you are done with one full game of wordle, simply type y to the prompt "did you finish the game?(Y for yes)" that will appear after every round.
